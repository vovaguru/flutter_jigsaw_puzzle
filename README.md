Column(
  children: [
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () async {
        await puzzleKey.currentState.generate();
      },
      child: const Text('Generate'),
    ),
    JigsawPuzzle(
      gridSize: 10,
      image: const AssetImage('assets/Jigsaw.jpg'),
      onFinished: () {
        // ignore: avoid_print
        print('finished!');
      },
      snapSensitivity: .5, // Between 0 and 1
      puzzleKey: puzzleKey,
      onBlockSuccess: () {
        // ignore: avoid_print
        print('block success!');
      },
    )
  ],
),
```
